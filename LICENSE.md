The license for Minicraft is complicated. Notch's tweets summarize the situation. (Source: http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=23463.msg669005#msg669005)

* Minicraft, my Ludum Dare game, is not Open Source. It has the source available because of LD rules, but there is no license. [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/notch/status/154211782548922368)
* Feel free to play around with it, but if you want to use if commercially, you need to talk to us at Mojang first. [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/notch/status/154212020013633537)
* You also can't re-release the code as open source. So those github things are technically not legal. ;) [tweet](https://twittercom/#!/notch/status/154212125840125953)
* I say that because people asked me to clarify. In reality, I don't care as long as you're not doing anything commercial with it. [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/notch/status/154212533530660864)
* .. but don't tell my lawyer I said that. [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/notch/status/154212581375090689)

My efforts here are therefore (and would be anyway) noncommercial, but the details of its license can likely not be determined until Minicraft's own license is clearer. For now, I'll choose [CC BY-NC 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).
